The pattern that I am seeing is that the the function named doubleInsert (which contains
the unshift function) is scaling an exponential way. It takes longer for doubleInsert to finish
doubling numbers adding and then adding an element at the beginning of the array. Meanwhile,
the doubleAppend function is able to scale better. This is because up until it reaches 
the XL array, the doubleAppend function which contains the push function is able to perform its
work in μs, so it is extremely fast in doubling the values and pushing new elements into the array.
